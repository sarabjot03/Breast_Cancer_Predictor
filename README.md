ðŸ©º Breast Cancer Predictor App
Overview
The Breast Cancer Predictor App is an interactive web-based application designed to predict the likelihood of a breast cancer tumor being malignant or benign using machine learning. The app employs an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model and provides a user-friendly interface powered by Streamlit.

Features
Interactive Web Interface: Users can input feature values using sliders and receive immediate predictions.
Real-Time Prediction: Determines whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on the provided inputs.
Visualization: Displays input data distribution through bar plots.
Educational Insights: Offers a friendly explanation of predictions and encourages early detection awareness.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Data Handling: pandas, numpy
Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
Machine Learning: scikit-learn
Web Deployment: streamlit

Application Workflow
Load Dataset:
The Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset is used, featuring 30 attributes and a binary target (malignant = 0, benign = 1).
Model Training:
A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model is trained using scikit-learn with default hyperparameters optimized for accuracy.
User Input:
Users interact with a sidebar form to adjust sliders representing feature values.
Prediction:
The app predicts the tumor's status based on the user's inputs and displays results alongside the input feature distribution.
Visualization:
Bar plots are dynamically generated to visualize user-provided feature values.
